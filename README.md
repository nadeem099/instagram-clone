# instagram_clone

An instagram clone built using Flutter and Firebase.

## Introduction
Flutter is a develpment kit created by google using which you can build apps for android and ios. You can user it to build web apps as well. I have started this project as a part of my practice in my flutter journy and built alot of features.

## Just to let you know
This project is currently under-development so there are lot of bugs to resolve and lot of features to add.
I have tried to mimic as many features of real instagram as possible in this app but still there are lot of features yet to be added and fixed.

## Technologies you need
--> If you know flutter and dart you are good to go but if you don't know and have other programming languages background or no programming background you can still work on it by following some tutorials[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTju8w4zEno&list=PLBxWkM8PLHcr2vkdY2n9rIcxjZ9Th3Us7] and docs[https://flutter.dev/docs].
--> Working with firebase database and storage is not a big deal follow the official docs[https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/firestore/usage/].

## Getting started
In order to get started you need to have few setups ready.
1) Android studio with flutter installed. You can follow this video[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDnqXmLSqtg&t=13s] for installation.
2) If you want to work on vs code that's also fine follow this tutorial[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5izFFbdHnWY].
3) An android emulator or real android device, you can run your app in chrome or edge as well but it is slow.
